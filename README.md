## Approach to the task
Creating a website involves several steps, and recreating specific pages from the Ioni.ai website with a unique touch is no different. Here's an approach to tackle this task:
### 1. Setting Up the Environment
To get started, make sure you have the necessary tools and environment set up.

### 2. Recreating the Landing Page

a. HTML Structure

Inspect the Ioni.ai landing page to understand its HTML structure. Create a similar structure in your Next.js project, using JSX for React components.

b. CSS Styling
Apply CSS classes to style the landing page components. You can customize the colors and fonts to match the original design or add your creative touch by modifying them.

c. Content
Replace the placeholder content with your own or replicate the content from the Ioni.ai website. Ensure that images, text, and other assets are properly integrated.

d. Responsive Design
Make sure your landing page is responsive. Test it on different screen sizes to ensure it looks good on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
